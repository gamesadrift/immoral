# (IM) MORAL


## (EN) English

(IM) MORAL is a competitive game, which may seem fast and chaotic at first but in which, with strategy, you can win any game.

The theme of the game is the conservation of spaces, whether natural or urban, in short, being a good citizen and taking care of the environment. For this, the players can use Bernie, the good-natured and altruistic hero of this story who seeks to keep everything in order; or Jonas who pursues him, destroying everything he touches.
