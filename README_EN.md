### Introduction

> (IM) MORAL is a competitive game, which may seem fast and chaotic at first but in which, with strategy, you can win any game.
>
> The theme of the game is the conservation of spaces, whether natural or urban, in short, being a good citizen and taking care of the environment. For this, the players can use Bernie, the good-natured and altruistic hero of this story who seeks to keep everything in order; or Jonas who pursues him, destroying everything he touches.
